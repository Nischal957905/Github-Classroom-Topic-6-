    	        <p class="eter">The module experience that the university of northampton has provided to us has been preety much fine till the date. UON has been providing the slides that includes most of the contents that one should learn inorder to be biulded up as a fine scholar. Well setting that aside there are various features about which I will like to applause  as well as complain or some of them.</p>
    	        <p class="guarn">Take a Note!</p>
    	        <ul class="muarn">
    	        	<li>The most important aspects that one should consider while being a full fledged developer has been taught.
    	        	</li>
    	        	<li>Major guidance for malpractise and good practise has been listed.</li>
    	        	<li>Despite of good module.There has been lack of the proper description that has to provided to the students. </li>
    	        	<li>Teachers that have been working have not been fully able to clear the misunderstanding of the students.</li>
    	        </ul>
    	    </div>
    	    <div class="terry">
    	    	<h2 class="jarr">Learning Basics</h2>
    	    	<p class="jarr1">Whatever that we did in the past days in our college has been mostly dedicated for building our bases strong.<br> These bases will help us in the upcoming days for building ourself as a proffessional as well as proper developer.<br>There were many guidance provided by the university in order to buid up our bases. Some of them are listed below.</p>
    	    	<ul class="jarr2">
    	    		<li>The first thing that was taught to me was the basic structure of Html. Therefore, Everything about developing a proper website was taught from scratch.</li>
    	    		<li>Validation of Html was taught inorder to draw out the flaws of the previous versions of html and advantage of the current version over the previous one. It helped me in practising in a profesional way.</li>
    	    		<li>Malpractise like frame tags! absolute positioning and font tags were avoided since they were not valid in the new version of Html.</li>
    	    		<li>Proper use of github was taught inorder to build up a proffesional behaviour of managing our code.</li>
    	    	</ul>
    	    	<p class="jarr3">I found various other things that are not listed here as well. I learnt the proper methods of writting codes here. Daily use of github allowed me to make my work easier since i was able to restore my previous versions. I learnt that it is more efficient to write your code yourself that using auto code generating text editors.</p>
